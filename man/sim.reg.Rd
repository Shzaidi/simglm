\title{Master simulation function.}
\usage{
sim.reg(fixed, random, random3, fixed.param, random.param, random.param3,
  cov.param, k, n, p, errorVar, randCor, randCor3, rand.dist, err.dist, serCor,
  serCorVal, data.str, fact.vars = list(NULL), unbal = FALSE,
  unbal3 = FALSE, unbalCont = NULL, unbalCont3 = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fixed}{One sided formula for fixed effects in the simulation.  To suppress intercept add -1 to formula.}

\item{random}{One sided formula for random effects in the simulation. Must be a subset of fixed.}

\item{random3}{One sided formula for random effects at third level in the simulation. Must be a subset of fixed
(and likely of random).}

\item{fixed.param}{Fixed effect parameter values (i.e. beta weights).  Must be same length as fixed.}

\item{random.param}{Variance of random effects. Must be same length as random.}

\item{random.param3}{Variance of third level random effects. Must be same length as random3.}

\item{cov.param}{List of mean and variance for fixed effects. Does not include intercept, time, or
interactions. Must be same order as fixed formula above.}

\item{k}{Number of third level clusters.}

\item{n}{Cluster sample size.}

\item{p}{Within cluster sample size.}

\item{errorVar}{Scalar of error variance.}

\item{randCor}{Correlation between random effects.}

\item{randCor3}{Correlation between third level random effects.}

\item{rand.dist}{Simulated random effect distribution.  Must be "lap", "chi", "norm", "bimod",
"norm" is default.}

\item{err.dist}{Simulated within cluster error distribution. Must be "lap", "chi", "norm", "bimod",
"norm" is default.}

\item{serCor}{Simulation of serial correlation. Must be "AR", "MA", "ARMA", or "ID", "ID" is default.}

\item{serCorVal}{Serial correlation parameters. A list of values to pass on to arima.sim.}

\item{data.str}{Type of data. Must be "cross", "long", or "single".}

\item{fact.vars}{A nested list of factor, categorical, or ordinal variable specification,
each list must include numlevels and var.type (must be "lvl1" or "lvl2");
optional specifications are: replace, prob, value.labels.}

\item{unbal}{A vector of sample sizes for the number of observations for each level 2
cluster. Must have same length as level two sample size n. Alternative specification
can be TRUE, which uses additional argument, unbalCont.}

\item{unbal3}{A vector of sample sizes for the number of observations for each level 3
cluster. Must have same length as level two sample size k. Alternative specification
can be TRUE, which uses additional argument, unbalCont3.}

\item{unbalCont}{When unbal = TRUE, this specifies the minimum and maximum level one size,
will be drawn from a random uniform distribution with min and max specified.}

\item{unbalCont3}{When unbal3 = TRUE, this specifies the minimum and maximum level two size,
will be drawn from a random uniform distribution with min and max specified.}

\description{
Takes simulation parameters as inputs and returns simulated data.
}
\details{
Simulated data is useful for classroom demonstrations and to study
the impacts of assumption violations on parameter estimates, statistical
power, or empirical type I error rates.

This function allows researchers a flexible approach to simulate regression
models, including single level models and cross sectional or longitudinal
linear mixed models (aka. hierarchical linear models or multilevel models).
